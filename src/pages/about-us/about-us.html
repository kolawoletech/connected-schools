In support of the South African government objective to improve the quality of education especially at foundation levels, the Foundation has refocused its strategy on education. The recent Annual National Assessment report released by the Department of Basic Education has affirmed the Foundation's choice of focus. Numeracy and Literacy are big challenges facing the country. Through strategic partnerships with government, civil society and other corporates, the Foundation has positioned itself to make meaningful impact in education.
